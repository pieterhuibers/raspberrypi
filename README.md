This repository contains dotfiles and scripts to set up a raspberry pi for different purposes.
There are some general (default) scripts that can be run to set up things like git and vim. Additionally, there
are more specific scripts that can be run to set up the raspberry pi for more specific purposes. At the moment
these are:

* Docker
* Kubernetes

The scripts will work on any Debian based image, for instance Raspbian (Lite)
